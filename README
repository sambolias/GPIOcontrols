GPIOcontrols

start testing now, probably need a controller to control memory leaks
initial idea pin has to work with input, so from a program
pout could be a program in PATH pout [pin] [0/1]

works for now, but leaving gpio exported could cause memory leaks
I don't think it is a big deal until working with multiple ports on the machine
